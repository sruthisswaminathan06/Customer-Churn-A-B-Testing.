# Customer Churn Prediction and A/B Testing using Python
# 📌 Project Overview

This project combines Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis to solve two critical business problems:


Customer Churn Prediction

Predict whether a customer will leave (churn) based on historical data.
Models used: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
Evaluation metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and AUC Score.



A/B Testing for Marketing Campaigns

Simulate two groups: Control vs Variant.
Perform hypothesis testing using t-test and Chi-square test.
Visualize conversion rates and interpret statistical significance.

✅ Key Features

🔍 Results & Interpretation

Customer Churn Prediction:

Random Forest generally outperforms Logistic Regression in accuracy and AUC.
ROC curve shows better separation for Random Forest.



A/B Testing:

If p-value < 0.05, the new campaign significantly improves conversion.
Visual comparison of conversion rates helps stakeholders make informed decisions.
